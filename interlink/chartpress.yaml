  # list of charts by name
  # each name should be the name of a Helm chart

    # with the --reset flag. It defaults to "set-by-chartpress".
    resetTag: latest
    # version to use when resetting the Chart.yaml's version field with the
    # --reset flag. It defaults to "0.0.1-set.by.chartpress". This is a valid
    # SemVer 2 version, which is required for a helm lint command to succeed.
    #resetVersion: 1.2.3-dev

    # baseVersion sets the base version for development tags,
    # instead of using the latest tag from `git describe`.
    # This gives you more control over development version tags
    # and lets you ensure prerelease tags are always sorted in the right order.
    # Only useful when publishing development releases.
    # Recommended together with a version-bumping tool like `tbump`.
    # if baseVersion is not a prerelease version (no -suffix),
    # the suffix `-0.dev` will be appended.
    #
    # Alternatively baseVersion can be set to "major", "minor", or "patch", then
    # baseVersion will be calculated based on the latest version tag from `git
    # describe`, but have its "major", "minor", or "patch" version increment if
    # the version isn't a pre-release.
    baseVersion: 0.0.1-0.dev
